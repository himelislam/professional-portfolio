            <h2>The Happy Hollisters</h2>

                <h2>Ex Libris: Confessions Of A Common Reader</h2>
                <h3>Anne Fadiman</h3>
                <p>Ex Libris is a collection of 18 essays by Anne Fadiman, that were originally published in ‘The Common Reader’ column of Civilization magazine. The book explores readers’ relationship with their books. In ‘Never Do That To A Book’, she writes about how people love their books in two major ways– courtly love, where the reader considers the physical state of a book sacrosanct and turns each page carefully when reading; and carnal love, where one reads a book again and again, even tearing up the pages, making notes in the margin, and damaging the covers in the process.</p>

                <h3>Tim Parks</h3>
                <p>In this wonderful collection of essays about the literary world, Where I’m Reading From, Tim Parks deals with important questions such as, should you finish every book you start; what happens to your brain when you read a great book; and what is wrong with the Nobel Prize. As a translator himself, he also talks about the difficulties of retaining the nuances while translating from one language to another. What makes Where I’m Reading From one of the best books about books is that it engages you deeply and makes you think about what it means to read and write.</p>
